## Project Overview: Beehive Health and Wildflower Initiative

Our initial idea revolves around supporting beekeepers and bee owners in maintaining the health of their beehives. We are developing a comprehensive business plan using the Business Model Canvas framework, focusing on various innovative approaches to improve beehive management.

**Key ideas we're exploring include:**

- Detecting potential threats to bees.
- Monitoring environmental factors that impact beehive health.
- Observing bee behaviors and how these influence the colony.
- Understanding the effects of temperature on bee activity.
  
As we delved deeper, another idea emerged: **encouraging people to grow more wildflowers**, which are a key food source for bees. This shift raised a critical question for us: How can we integrate technology to support this initiative?

One solution is to develop an app that helps users identify the types of wildflowers they are planting. Through this app, we can gather data from users to assess the effectiveness of our wildflower campaign. However, given the time constraints and my responsibility for the technology aspect of the project, we are considering leveraging existing solutions.

## Leveraging Technology: Plant Identification
Rather than building an entirely new system, we can utilize existing APIs, such as the Plant ID API. This API allows users to input images of plants, and in return, it provides the names of the flowers or plants in the images. By integrating this technology, we can streamline development and focus on gathering valuable data for our initiative.
